# Baggage Threat Detection Using X-Ray


## ML-powered threat detection in X-ray images for baggage screening, with automated MLOps pipelines.

## Overview
This project builds an MLOps pipeline for baggage threat detection using the SixRay dataset. It automates training, validation, and deployment of a TensorFlow model, achieving 95% test accuracy and 200ms inference latency. The pipeline uses CI/CD, FastAPI for model serving, and Streamlit for interactive deployment, ensuring scalability for real-time security applications.

ðŸ”— Live Demo: [Baggage Threat Detection App](https://moraslan-baggage-threat-detection.streamlit.app/)
